      'At Maghraut Technologies, we\'ve always believed that true innovation isn\'t just measured by the solutions we build—but by the lives we touch.',
      'When we first heard about the Pledge 1% movement at TDX Bangalore during a Salesforce event, it resonated deeply with our values. The idea is simple: commit 1% of equity, profit, product, or employee time to support causes that matter. But behind that simplicity lies a profound truth—small contributions, when made collectively, can create monumental impact.',
      'For us, it\'s not just a pledge—it\'s a philosophy. Whether it\'s empowering nonprofits with technology, enabling our team to volunteer their time, or offering pro bono services to organizations driving real change, we\'re committed to using our capabilities for a purpose beyond profit.',
      'We\'re proud to stand with a global community of companies that believe in giving back. Proud to be part of something bigger. Proud to be Maghraut—where technology meets compassion, and where every 1% is a step toward a better world.',
      'Join us on this journey. Let\'s build impact together.'
